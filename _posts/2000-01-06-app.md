# The Reporting Dashboard

![img](/img/mobile.png)

The web app presents users with a map showing their current location,
and nearby airports and flight paths. This information is presented to
allow the user to infer what flight a contrail may have come from. The
page is responsive, meaning that it adjusts to screen size: it works
equally well on a mobile device or a computer screen.

If the user would like to report a contrail sighting, they hit the
*Capture* button. They are then asked to take a photo, or upload an
existing one, and given the option to add a comment to the
sighting. In future, the app will also show other recent contrail
sightings in your area. Apart from some other administrative options
(such as *About* and *Contact*), the interface is kept simple and
minimum.
