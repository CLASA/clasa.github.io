# CLASA

### *Clouds for NASA*

An integrated solution for getting contrail sightings from your mobile
to the scientists' desktop.

CLASA supplied an online web dashboard where you can report contrail
sightings. Doing so allows NASA to build a database on contrails, with
data like where contrails are forming, how long they're hanging around
for, and what effect they might be having on the environment.

*Sorry*, the app is no longer live. But keep on scrolling for
screenshots.
