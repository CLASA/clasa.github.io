# The solution

The proposed solution consists of two phases of data collection. In
Phase I, data collection relies on crowdsourcing, and for
participation from the public. In Phase II, data collection becomes
automated and the rate at which data may be collected is
accelerated. The project is currently in Phase â… .

## Phase I


*The Dashboard:* The web dashboard is designed to provide a simple
platform for users to report contrail sightings, and to upload
pictures of the contrails. This platform is targeted at users who wish
to participate and inform NASA altruistically. It is designed to be
fast and easy to use. A web app is used so that users don't need to
download the product ahead of time.

*Machine Vision:* Users are required to upload a picture of the
sighted contrail with their report. The reason for this is twofold:

-   Firstly to provide data integrity. A classifier is able to determine
    the likelihood that images contain contrails, flagging suspected
    "problem" users.
-   To provide a large learning dataset for extending to Phase II.

### Phase IA

*Note that this part of Phase I is not yet implemented.*

*The Game:* Should the standard web dashboard not attract enough end
users, alternative markets may be used to acquire users.
