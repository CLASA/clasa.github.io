* Machine Vision
Machine vision is used to automatically identify the likelihood an
image contains a contrail. The algorithm developed is explained in
further detail in the Readme on its [[https://github.com/CLASA/Contrail-Machine-Vision][GitHub page]].

In brief, first image pre-processing ensures that all images arriving
to the algorithm are consistent, regardless of the camera used or the
lighting in the image.

Next a set of /features/ are extracted. These are mathematical
properties of the image that we think might help the computer know if
contrails are present or not. A /classifier/ is trained using a
series of input data. For the challenge, this data was obtained using
Google Images, searching for "contrails" and "cirrus". The classifier
used was a Random Forest classifier.

The classifier was able to achieve about 75% accuracy. We believe this
could be greatly improved with some development and a better dataset.
