* Clouds or Contrails
This product was developed as a part of the NASA [[2016.spaceappschallenge.org][Space Apps]] challenge,
solving the proposed [[2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/aero/clouds-or-contrails][Clouds or Contrails]] challenge. This challenge
sees competitors design an app for identifying and tracking contrails.

** What are contrails?
Contrails are the streaks of clouds left behind planes as they fly
through the sky. They are formed due to the plane's exhaust causing
moisture in the air to condense. It is estimated that in some parts of
the world, contrails may account for up to 2% [[[1][1]]] of the cloud cover: a
small yet potentially significant amount.

The big problem is: /we don't know!/

More data on contrails is required to be able to answer many of the
looming questions. CLASA proposes a solution in which /you/ hold the
key to help collect this data.
